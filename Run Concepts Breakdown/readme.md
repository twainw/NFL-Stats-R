## What is this?
A table that shows every Primary Run Concept an NFL team uses in a given season. FTN charts Primary Run Concept on every play: 
- **Zone Runs**: Inside Zone, Outside Zone.
- **Gap Scheme Runs**: Man/Duo, Power, Counter, Trap, Draw.
- **Other Concepts**: WR Run, FB Run, QB Sneak, Kneel, No Design, Scrambles.

The table shows how often a team has used a run concept (% of all runs and compared to the rest of the league) and how effective they are (succcess % and epa/play)

## About the data used
- Run concept from FTN. All other data (logos, epa, success %) from #nflverse.
- Total runs for each team won't match PFR b/c I take out kneel downs.

A huge thank you to FTN and nflverse developers for the data.
